        Firefox is the only <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/" target="_blank">browser</a> that puts you first, to share this message, Mozilla launched, <a href="https://firefoxflicks.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Firefox Flicks</a>, a global video contest. Users, fans, filmmakers, animators and people with creativity and an appreciation for Firefox participated in the contest by creating a short video to share our message. The last date for the Submissions was May 1st 2012. There were more than 400 submissions, 1000 plus filmmakers from around the world! We had a great time watching all the videos.
