  Hi all,</p>

  <p>
    Yesterday when I was in the office , I suddenly got a call from a student with name <a class="g-profile" href="https://plus.google.com/113974839307702523775" target="_blank">+Mukesh Thodupunoori</a> saying that he need to conduct a session regarding the Mozilla and start the Mozilla Club in their college.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I was so surprised and asked him few questions below.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1. Why are you going to start the club in the college ? <br /><a class="g-profile" href="https://plus.google.com/113974839307702523775" target="_blank">+Mukesh Thodupunoori</a>  : I was so impressed , interested, excited by the activities of what <a class="g-profile" href="https://plus.google.com/107964393728911462914" target="_blank">+Mozilla Firefox</a> are doing in various places in India and I want my college students to be part of this great initiative ,join and support for the Open Web #rightnow.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    2. How are you going to kick start then ?<br /><a class="g-profile" href="https://plus.google.com/113974839307702523775" target="_blank">+Mukesh Thodupunoori</a> : I was running a facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/myfirefoxOS" target="_blank">(Firefox OS)</a> ,started contributing to localization as well and wanted <a class="g-profile" href="https://plus.google.com/118439463786613963347" target="_blank">Me (+Srikar Ananthula)</a> to present a introductory session on Mozilla and how to get started , so we proceed further with more activities in college
  </p>
  
  <p>
    3. What made you to join this community ?<br />I Loved the mission of the Mozilla that is the Non Profit Organization, which helps to make the web better and thus started the journey towards it 🙂
  </p>
  
  <p>
    4.When are planning to do it ?<br /><a class="g-profile" href="https://plus.google.com/113974839307702523775" target="_blank">+Mukesh Thodupunoori</a> : Tomorrow morning itself. I said &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; .He answered in confident manner &#8220;Yes, Tomorrow&#8221;. I was impressed and said &#8220;Ok ! Lets do it tomorrow&#8221;.
  </p>
