Hi,

What is this about? Well, we are a bunch of enthusiastic people working in automation, all kinds of tools and various projects and we’d like to introduce you to this part of Mozilla.

It’s an opportunity to learn new things and experience automation on different projects.

Most of the tasks will be added to the One and Done tool and you can also check our etherpad for latest updates:

We plan to have 4 consecutive training days, each Wednesday until June 11th
  
Timings are from 11:30AM &#8211; 3:30 AM IST
  
Hope to meet you next Wednesday!! Happy learning !!
